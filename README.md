### Post installation steps

- [x] Verify installation
- [x] Insert NSC3 license
- [x] Configure NSC3 organisation

#### Verify installation
Check docker containers, Totally number of running containers is 16 without optional features

    sudo docker ps
    sudo docker stats

Check Web services, Expected result if ok, "HTTP/2 200"

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    source nsc-host.env
    curl -I --http2 -s https://$PUBLICIP
    
Check SSL Certification status, Expected result when ok, "SSL certificate verify ok"
```
curl --cert-status -v https://$PUBLICIP 2>&1 | awk 'BEGIN { cert=0 } /^\* Server certificate:/ { cert=1 } /^\*/ { if (cert) print }'
```    
#### Insert NSC3 license

Login to the NSC3 web app as admin
- Initial admin login. org: admin login user and password: admin. System is proposing to change password right after first successful login session.
- Download a instance key via NSC3 admin/license UI. Licenses Tab / Server license / Set new NSC3 license / Download Instance key
- Send the instance key file via NSION Jira Service desk support portal.
- NSION will prepare and return a corresponding license key file back. No need to left UI open while waiting
- Insert license key via NSC3 admin/license UI. Licenses Tab / Server license / Set new NSC3 license / Insert license key (download from local computer via Web app)

#### Configure NSC organisation

NSC3 Admin documentation: https://www.nsiontec.com/user-guide-webapp-admin/ 

### Upgrade NSC3

Downlaod the latest scripts from github:

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    chmod u-x *.sh
    git pull -f
    
Grant execute rights for the upgrade script:

    chmod u+x nsc3-upgrade.sh
    
Start upgrade process:

    sudo ./nsc3-upgrade.sh
    
Note that release tag format is 
    
    release-<release number>, e.g: release-3.14  
    
### NSC3 Maintenance

#### Managing NSC3 containers:

Stop NSC3 services:

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    sudo docker-compose down

Start NSC3 services:

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    sudo docker-compose up -d  

Restart NSC3 container:

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    sudo docker-compose restart [NSC3 container]

#### Monitoring NSC3 runtime environment:

Monitor container logs via docker logs:

    sudo docker logs <container name>
    
Check disk storage usage level:

    df -hT | grep /$ | awk '{ print $6}'
    
Check computer free RAM memory:

    echo $(free -g | grep Mem: | awk '{ print $7}') "GB"
    
Container status:

    sudo docker stats

#### Update SSL certification

Copy new cert file to $HOME/nsc/nsc-gateway-cert.

If the existing cert will be updated then only cert file need to be replaced.

Naming rule: 
- privatekey: privkey.pem
- SSL cert: fullchain.pem

E.g if you have changed SSL cert files then nsc-gateway-service requires restarting in order to take into use a new cert file.

```
sudo docker-compose restart nsc-gateway
```

#### Relocating the Docker root directory

If the file space in the Docker root directory is not adequate, you must relocate the directory.

1. Stop NSC3 services:
```
cd $HOME/nsc3
sudo docker-compose down
```
2. Stop Docker services:
```
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
sudo systemctl stop containerd
```
3. Create the necessary directory structure into which to move Docker root by running the following command. This directory structure must reside on a file system with at least 50 GB free disk space. Significantly more disk space might be required depending on your daily ingestion volumes and data retention policy.
```
sudo mkdir -p /<new_dir_structure>
```
4. Move Docker root to the new directory structure:
```
sudo mv /var/lib/docker /<new_dir_structure>
```
5. Edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json. If the file does not exist, create the file by running the following command:
```
sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
Add the following information to this file:

	{
  	"data-root": "/<new_dir_structure>/docker"
	}

6. After the /etc/docker/daemon.json file is saved and closed, restart the Docker services:
```
sudo systemctl start docker
```	
After you run the command, all Docker services through dependency management will restart.

7. Validate the new Docker root location:
```
docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir}}'
```
8. Start NSC3 services:
```
cd $HOME/nsc3
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
    
### NSC3 system troubleshooting

#### No access to NSC3 services:

Try to restart NSC3 services:

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    sudo docker-compose up -d 
    
Check https status: 
Expected result if ok, "HTTP/2 200"

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    source nsc-host.env
    curl -I --http2 -s https://$PUBLICIP
    
If still no access please then check ...
- Network status
- Disk space usage level
- Docker status

#### NSC3 Web service is not working properly:

##### Check that SSL cert is valid: Expected result if ok, "SSL certificate verify ok"

    cd $HOME/nsc3
    source nsc-host.env

```
curl --cert-status -v https://$PUBLICIP 2>&1 | awk 'BEGIN { cert=0 } /^\* Server certificate:/ { cert=1 } /^\*/ { if (cert) print }'
```
##### Check that the HTTPS port is listening:

    ss -lntu | grep ':443'
    
##### Validate cert file and private key files:

######  Cert files location:

	$HOME/nsc3/nsc-gateway-cert
	

###### Check that privkey.pem first line looks as below 

	-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

```
cat privkey.pem
```
	
	
###### Check that fullchain.pem first line looks as below

	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

```
cat fullchain.pem
```
	
###### Check that private key and cert files are paired together: Expected result -> both md5 checksum values are equal
	
privkey check sum: 

```	
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in privkey.pem | openssl md5
```

cert check sum: 

```
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in fullchain.pem | openssl md5
```

###### SSL Cert file is chained with dns_operator + service certs: Expected result -> number is more than 1

```
cat fullchain.pem | grep "BEGIN" | wc -l
```
###### Restart nsc-gateway services

E.g if you have changed SSL cert files then nsc-gateway-service requires restarting in order to take into use a new cert file.

```
sudo docker-compose restart nsc-gateway
```

##### Check TCP IP route from external network to NSC3 https port:

This requires extra tool called nmap:
As example Ubuntu installation

    sudo apt install nmap
    
Test that route to 443 port is open:

    nmap <hostname> | grep 443
