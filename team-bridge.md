# NSC3 Team-Bridge Service

Release tag: `release-3.15`

## Team-Bridge Service description:

NSC3 Team-Bridge Service is designed to broadcast live-stream between independent NSC3 servers.
Team-Bridge commication pipe is linking NSC3 Servers organisations together. Pipes can be one-directional or bi-directional. Communication protocol can be TCP or UDP. Only the TCP pipe is encrypted.

Team-Bridge service is managing live-stream broadcasting from devices per specified organisation. In order to avoid overlapping with device indentifications the original device identifications at source organisation is renamed at destination organisation. Team-Bridge is syncronizing only live-stream data from devices, exclusing users identified data and storaged data content.

### One-Directional pipe:

One-Directional pipe contains two elements, client and server. Dataflow point of view the client node is defining source organisation and the server node is defining the source/destination organisation. 

Pre-requisites for installation:
- 2 x NSC3 servers installed
- admin credentials for NSC3
- IP address for both servers
- Organisation ID for source and destination NSC3 organisations -> Org ID is visible via NSC3 Admin panel
- Team-Bridge specific port 64660 open for Team-Bridge server

### Bi-Directional pipe:

Bi-Directional pipe combines both elements client and server that need to installed at both end. Dataflow point of view it is similar as in case of One-Directional link but along two pipes outbound and inbound directions. 

In order to get this concept working accordingly, Bi-Directional pipe requires two organizations that need to be created on both servers. Inside of NSC3 server those two independent organisations can be link together by JontOps tasks. Note that Joint Operations functionality in NSC3 requires dedicated license.

Pre-requisites for installation:
- 2 x NSC3 servers installed
- admin credentials for NSC3
- IP address for both servers
- 2 x NSC3 organisations defined at both server
- Organisation ID for source and destination NSC3 organisations for both directions -> Org ID is visible via NSC3 Admin panel
- Team-Bridge specific port 64660 is open for both servers

## TCP key-pairs:

TCP key-pairing is mandatory part of TCP protocol based dataflow pipes to enable encrypted data pipes.
Installation process will take case of TCP key-pair creation.
It is mandatory manual step to do in order to ensure that server side and client side is paired accordingly.
Copy the keypair file bundle directory only once from the server where the bundle is created in the first place to other end server. Installation process will remind that separately. Installation process won't overwrite existing key-pairs if files are existing at specified location.

After first TCP mode installation the key-pair bundle is located to folder:

``` bash
$HOME/nsc3/bridgekeys
```

Copy them to corresponding folder on other end server.
e.g with scp command

``` bash
scp -r $HOME/nsc3/bridgekeys <username>@<server2>:./nsc3/.
```

Key-pairs can be generated separately by command
``` bash
generateTeamBridgeRSAKeyPairs.sh
```

## Troubleshooting UDP

To test if the server is running and can be connected to, linux command line utility `netcat` can be
used to write something into it.

``` bash
sudo netcat localhost 64660 -u
```

Type something into the terminal, press enter to send and observe server container logs from another
terminal with `docker logs -f nsc-team-bridge-service`. A protobuf exception should get logged as the
plain text message is unexpected format.
